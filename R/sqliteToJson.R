## Code for creating json records from the sqlite DB.

## RIGHT NOW the json looks sort of record centric.  So I need to make
## code that takes AHMs and makes them into JSON.


## So 1st I need an exemplar AHM (will save one for now in inst/extdata

## So for testing: 
## load(system.file('extData','inpDrosPsuedo.rda', package='AnnotationHubData'))
